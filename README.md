## <font color='blue'>** Analysis of used cars, posted for sale in the U.S.(a machine learning practice sample)**</font>
   in this project, I work on a dataset that contains information of the car sale posts in craiglist for the month of June and July, 2021. Each entry contains information about  time and location of the post, all details of the car/truck/... posted including  size, model, maker, odometer, year, and desired price and description of the car  provided by the poster. The dataset contains nearly half of a million samples. I looked at this dataset from a few angles. First I did some data visualization. Then I set some basic measures to see if the seller is from a dealership or not. Finally, Decision Tree, Random Forest and neural network models were developed to predict the price of the used cars based on the details of the cars in the posts.

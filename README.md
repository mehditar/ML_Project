## <font color='blue'>** Analysis of used cars, posted for sale in the U.S.**</font>
   in this project, I work on a dataset that contains information of  car sale posts in craiglist for the months of June and July, 2021. Each entry contains information about  time and location of the post, all details of the car/truck/... posted including  size, model, maker, odometer, year, and desired price and description/text provided by the poster. The dataset contains nearly half of a million samples. I looked at this dataset from a few angles. First, I did some data visualizations. Then, I set some basic measures to see if the seller/poster is from a dealership or not. Finally, Decision Tree, Random Forest and artificial neural network models were developed to predict the price tag of a post based on the details of the cars in the posts.
